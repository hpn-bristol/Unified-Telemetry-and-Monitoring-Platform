The **Unified Telemetry and Monitoring Platform** provides an end-to-end solution for collecting, storing, streaming and visualising telemetry data in optical networks.
It integrates **InfluxDB, Apache Kafka, Telegraf, Grafana and Kadeck**, enabling real-time network/device performance monitoring and supporting AI/ML-based applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ voyager.py # Collects monitoring data from Voyagers and saves it into CSV

â”œâ”€â”€ data from voyager to Kafka.txt # Python Kafka Producer: pushes Voyager data to Kafka

â”œâ”€â”€ data from InfluxDB to Kafka.txt # Reads data from InfluxDB and pushes it to Kafka

â”œâ”€â”€ data from Kafka to InfluxDB.txt # Telegraf Config: Pushes data from Kafka to InfluxDB

â”œâ”€â”€ flask_app.txt # Flask app example (receives telemetry data via HTTP)

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Start Services**
   
   Â   - Install InfluxDB and Kafka (see instructions in the User Guide PDF)
   
   Â   - Start Zookeeper and Kafka broker

3. **Send Data to Kafka**
   
   Â   - python "data from voyager to Kafka.txt" # change voyager to the device that you want to monitor

5. **Consume Data and Write to InfluxDB**

   Â   - Configure Telegraf with "data from Kafka to InfluxDB.txt"

   Â   - Start Telegraf service

4. **Visualise with Grafana**

   Â   - Connect Grafana to InfluxDB

   Â   - Build dashboards for BER, OSNR, CD, and other device metrics

5. **Send Data from the Distributed Databases to the Centralised Database**

   Â   - python "data from InfluxDB to Kafka.txt"

   Â   - Configure Telegraf with "data from Kafka to InfluxDB.txt"
   
      - Start Telegraf service
